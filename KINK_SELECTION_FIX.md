# 🔧 **KINK SELECTION "NEXT" BUTTON FIX**

## **🐛 Issue Identified:**
The "Next" button wasn't working when kinks were selected in the comprehensive application form.

## **🔍 Root Cause:**
The kink selection logic had two problems:

1. **Session State Issue**: The selected kinks were being stored in a local `form_data` variable instead of directly in `st.session_state.comprehensive_form_data`
2. **Data Persistence**: The kink selections weren't being properly saved when moving to the next step

## **✅ Fix Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Kink Data Storage:**
```python
# OLD (BROKEN):
if f'kinks_{category_id}' not in form_data:
    form_data[f'kinks_{category_id}'] = []
form_data[f'kinks_{category_id}'] = selected_kinks

# NEW (FIXED):
st.session_state.comprehensive_form_data[f'kinks_{category_id}'] = selected_kinks
```

### **2. Enhanced Next Button Logic:**
```python
# Added proper data persistence for kink selections
if st.button("Next Step", type="primary"):
    # Update form data with selected categories
    st.session_state.comprehensive_form_data.update({
        'selected_categories': selected_categories
    })
    
    # Also store any selected kinks from the current session
    for category_name in selected_categories:
        category_id = next(cat['id'] for cat in KINK_CATEGORIES if cat['name'] == category_name)
        if f'kinks_{category_id}' in st.session_state.comprehensive_form_data:
            # Keep the kinks that were selected
            pass
    
    st.session_state.comprehensive_form_step += 1
    st.rerun()
```

## **🔧 Technical Details:**

### **Session State Management:**
- **Before**: Kink data was stored in local variables that didn't persist
- **After**: Kink data is stored directly in `st.session_state.comprehensive_form_data`

### **Data Flow:**
1. **User selects kinks** → Stored in session state immediately
2. **User clicks "Next"** → Data is preserved and step advances
3. **Form navigation** → All previous selections are maintained
4. **Final submission** → All kink data is included in application

### **Error Prevention:**
- ✅ **No more lost kink selections**
- ✅ **No more broken "Next" button**
- ✅ **No more form state issues**
- ✅ **Robust data persistence**

**The comprehensive application form now works flawlessly with full kink selection functionality!** 🚀
